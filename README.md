# Java
Re-learning Java in Codecademy, this is what I am working on so far.

_Important_
- To compile and execute a file you must enter commands in the terminal
  - To compile file type: ```javac [fileName].java```
    - If no error, compiler executes without any feedback
    - If error, compiler may print:
      - ```compiling.java:4: error: ';' expected    System.out.println("Java is a class-based language.")                                                         ^1 error```
  - To "list" the availabe file(s) type: ```ls```
    - If you type ```ls``` before compiling, output may look like:
      - ```Compiling.java```
    - If you type ```ls``` after compiling, output may look like:
      - ```Compiling.class  Compiling.java``` <-- Hey look, a ```class``` file!
  - Dont run ```javac [fileName].class``` in the terminal or the output may look like:
    - ```javac: invalid flag: Compiling.class    Usage: javac <options> <source files>    use --help for a list of possible options```
  - Run ```java Compiling``` to display the output in the terminal!
